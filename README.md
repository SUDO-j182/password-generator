# password-generator

This was my second project and the first time I began working with JavaScript to build something interactive. After finishing my CV page, I wanted to create a small tool that would push me to learn basic programming logic while keeping the interface simple and clean.

The idea was to build a password generator that lets users choose their character types and length, then outputs a secure, random password. It also includes a styled interface designed to look like a terminal, with subtle animations and a retro feel that reflects some of my design influences.

## Features

- Random password generation using custom character sets
- User-controlled options for length and character types
- Styled terminal-like interface with typewriter animation
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

## Why This Project Matters

This was the first time I started to understand how JavaScript could control the behaviour of a page. It taught me how to structure functions, work with user input, and manipulate the DOM. While still a small tool, it marked the start of me thinking like a developer—breaking problems into parts and solving them with code. It also gave me ideas for the pixel editor I would build next.

## Future Improvements

- Add keyboard accessibility
- Include password strength indicators
- Refactor into modular functions for easier maintenance
- Add error handling and validation for edge cases
- Convert to a Progressive Web App with offline access
